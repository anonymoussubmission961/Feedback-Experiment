        "text": "To express $$h(x)=(x+2)^2$$ as a composition of two functions h(x) = f(g(x)), we need to break it down into two separate functions, f(x) and g(x), where one function is applied inside the other.\\nThe function $$h(x)=(x+2)^2$$ is basically squaring the result of adding 2 to x. So, we can divide this operation into two parts: the inner part g(x), which adds 2 to x, and the outer part f(x), which squares its input.\\nFor g(x) = x + 2: This represents the operation of adding 2 to x, which matches the inner operation of h(x).\\nFor $$f(x)=x^2$$: This represents the operation of squaring the input, which is the outer operation applied to the result of g(x).\\nSo, when you combine these two functions, you get $$h(x)=f(g(x))=(g(x))^2=(x+2)^2$$, which matches the given h(x).\\nTherefore, the correct answer is g(x) = x + 2, $$f(x)=x^2$$.",
